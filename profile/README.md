### _Welcome to Knowledge Hub for E-invoicing APIs (KHEA)_

## What is KHEA?
As E-Invoicing is being mandated across the world, we believe APIs have a critical role to play in in enabling small solution providers and startups to create custom solutions cheaply and efficiently. Consequently, Knowledge Hub for E-invoicing APIs (KHEA) is a community-driven initiative whose goal is consolidating important information and knowledge in this space. In doing so, KHEA will play a key role in bringing API creators and users together and make information on all existing e-Invoicing APIs available to developers and solution providers

## Public Available APIs
Our KHEA Repository classifies the E-invoicing APIs into four basice E-invoicing operations: Invoice Creation, Invoice Transformation, Invoice Validation and Invoice Communication. Below is the classification of APIs in specific E-Invoicing categories with their details and business parameters.
