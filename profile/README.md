# KHEA
### _Welcome to Knowledge Hub for E-invoicing APIs_

## What is Khea?
As e-invoicing is being mandated across the world, we believe APIs have a critical role to play in in enabling small solution providers and startups to create custom solutions cheaply and efficiently. KHEA is a community-driven initiative whose goal is consolidating important information and knowledge in this space. In doing so, KHEA will play a key role in bringing API creators and users together.

#### How to document an existing API?
The first part is to explain what the possibilities of the API in question. What its capabilities are. The next step is to ensure the current documentation is available to the accesssible to either an internal setting or publicly accesssible. This is sop ther users can provide feedback and questions about the API.
#### How to locate APIs?
API marketplaces, simple google search and developer forums and websites
