# KHEA
### _Welcome to Knowledge Hub for E-invoicing APIs_

## What is Khea?
As e-invoicing is being mandated across the world, we believe APIs have a critical role to play in in enabling small solution providers and startups to create custom solutions cheaply and efficiently. KHEA is a community-driven initiative whose goal is consolidating important information and knowledge in this space. In doing so, KHEA will play a key role in bringing API creators and users together.
